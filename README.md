# WebsiteFun
Building a personal website for fun. Goal is to use it as a platform to post information I find interesting as well as some educational material on Stocks, Crypto, Traveling, and Software Development.

## Main Focus
- Get env variables set up

- Configure dev and production build paths in package-json.

- Clean up moblie layout in public/something.css

- Allow for caching and dynmaic responses

- probably 30 other things I'm missing

- Have fun
