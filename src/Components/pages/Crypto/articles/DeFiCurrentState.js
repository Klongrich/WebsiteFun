            DeFi! It’s all the rage in their ether space here in 2020. 
            From projects like $YFI and $CURV to other DEX’s like Uniswap 
            and Moonswap. Also not to forget Projects like MakerDAO.
            But What the fuck is all this? Honestly, I think most people
            using these systems and speculating on them don’t understand 
            what they are or used for.
        </p>

        <p>
        At a high level you could break the DeFi down into 3 main areas (Right now that is)
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>1.) Yield Farming</li>
            <li>2.) DEX (Decentralized Exchange) </li>
            <li>3.) Stable Coins / Collateralized Lending </li>
        </ul>

        <p>

        So let’s start off explaining why I find each one to be very interesting. 

        </p>
            

        <h2> DEX (Decentralized Exchanges) </h2>

        <p> These have very good use cases. </p>

        <p> One is that all you need is a free downloadable wallet to trade. 
            This is awesome because if you look at the history of exchanges 
            here in the US after 2017 they banned poloniex, bitfinex, bitmex, 
            etc and started requiring SSN and passport / state ID photos in order 
            for you to purchase crypto currency basically so they can track and 
            tax you.
        </p> 

        <p> Two, It allows anyone to “list” a token whenever they want and have 
            access to a potential liquidity pool. This is good news for people wanting 
            to launch newer projects. Rather than being forced to go through a VC 
            or accredited investor, they can acquire early stage funding from multiple 
            people and allow them to trade their token instantly.
        </p>

        <p> Three, It is borderless. This means it doesn't matter where you are in the world 
        when using these. You also don’t have as many hoops to group through when it 
        comes  to government regulation in regards to transactions, delivering software 
        / products, and raising money.
        </p> 

        <p> Four, being that your private keys are not kept on anyone's server. Meaning that 
        you actually own the crypto that you are trading / exchanging.
        </p>


        <h2> Yield Farming </h2>

        <p> This is basically where you move around funds to get the highest APR or return 
        possible within a given time. In DeFi right now most of the returns are coming 
        from liquidity pools for exchanges. This is cool because it allows liquidity to 
        flow around to multiple different platforms of exchange rather than just one 
        larger platform. 
        </p>

        <h2> Stable coins / collateralized lending </h2>

        <p> This is another really good project that is coming out of the DeFi space 
            right now. MakerDAO allows anyone to have access to 50% margin on ETH which 
            is pretty awesome considering the US government tried banning all exchanges 
            with margin and the use of margin in general in the crypto space. 
        </p>

        <p> This also allows the crypto community to have 1 to 1 value with USD without 
            having to have access to physical USD or a bank that has all their information 
            like ID, Social Security, etc …
        </p>


        <p> Overall there are a lot of cool things and use cases for projects that are 
            going on within the DeFi space in crypto. Considering the amount of onchain 
            storage is limited for now it makes sense this is where projects are heading. 
            Excited to see what other projects come out 4 to 5 years from now. 
        </p>
