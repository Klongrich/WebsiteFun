        The Ethereum white paper was first introduced in November 2013 by Vitalik Buterin. This outlined the goals for ethereum and caught the attention of the crypto community. The yellow paper for ethereum was then introduced by Gavin Wood who outlined how the EVM would be implemented. Development started through a swiss company called Ethereum Switzerland GmbH (c.o.o Joseph Lubin). A swiss based non-profit called the Ethereum Foundation was formed as well.

        Development was funded by an online crowdsale (or ICO) that took place between July and August in 2014. One Ether sold for approximately $0.31 and they managed to raise $18 million over the course of 42 days. The first release of Ethereum was on July 30, 2015 and was soon listed on many exchanges.

        On July 17th, 2016 the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) was hacked for approximately 3.6 million Ether or about $50 million at the time of the hack. (Now worth $662 million). This sparked concervesty over what actions should be taken in the result of the hack. Essentially the Ethereum foundation decided to create a hard fork of the crypto currency creating ETC (Ethereum Classic) and ETH (Ethereum). ETC let the hack be while ETH reversed the hack and deposited funds back into those who had their ether stolen. The reason for the concervesty was that the foundation was able to back track transactions which they should not be able to do according to their principles.

        Etheruem works as an extension of the ideas of Bitcoin and the Block-chain. Rather than using decentralization for just transactions, Etheruem aimed to allow programmable contracts or agreements to be stored on the block-chain as well. This allows all kinds of interesting use cases to now be possible. In 2017 ICO’s became a very hot topic / use case for Ethereum. Due to lack of education and understanding in the space however, many scams were pulled off through these ICO’s giving them a bad rep. Some examples of successful ICO’s would be Brave (BAT) or ChainLink (LINK). ICO’s allow developers and founders to mitigate having to raise funds through a VC or qualified accredited investors. It also allows crowd funding from the entire globe and access to early investments for anyone.

        In 2019 and 2020 Ethereum new hot topic has been used in things like DeFi (Decentralized Fiance) as well as things like ERC721 Tokens that can prove you have done something, been somewhere, or own a collectible. Talk of DeFi is centered around things such as the MakerDao and Stable coins. They use colartized lending to issue tokens that are pegged to the value of $1 USD. It does this by you staking 100% in return for 50% in DAI. Then in case of a price collapse in ETH margin calls come in place and allow people to buy your debt in return for a small profit paid from interest of the DAI issued.

        Privacy has also been a hot topic  in the Ether space in 2020. The look into using it to scale transactions is now becoming a real thing. Things like rk-rollups are being implemented for ETH 2. This allows users to verify that they are the person they say they are without giving up their exact identity which is very important. Stateless clients also aim to allow storage to scale along with things like sharding and the beacon chain. This will allow other transactions and storage to take place on more than just the main chain of ethereum. They are also looking to switch from mining to a PoS (Proof of Stake) model using casper as their consensus algorithm.. The minimum amount to be a validator node (or Staker) will be 32 ETH. APR (Annual return percentage) for staking will be determined by the amount that is being staked on the network. Some say high as 8% of your ETH staked, others are saying much lower. This will allow for and increase in TPS (transactions per second) on the network and a decrease of electricity used to verify transactions. This also makes the development of ASIC impossible.

        The date for the full switch over to ETH 2 remains unclear. However It has been stated that the switch will not happen all at once. Instead it will be rolled out over the course of many phases. Phase 0 being the ETH 2.0 main test net launched (Topaz Test Net)  which was 2 days ago on April 16h, 2020. Currently is one of the largest test nets with over 30,000 validators. Much progress has been made by the prystaic labs, lighthouse, and many others in the ETH scaling space. Predictions of allowing thousands of transactions per-second instead of only a few once the full ETH 2 is launched. This making it more applicable for Enterprise use cases.  Much more to come from the ETH team I am sure.
