        <Paragraph>
        Ripple is a crypto currency that I will disclose I have a strong bias against. This is due to the fact that it is much more centralized than other forms of crypto currencies. However, this allows ripple to be extremely cheap and very fast in terms of transactions. Ripple only has a total of 70 validator nodes all owned and maintained by Ripple. Bitcoin has 7,992 nodes and Ethereum has 6,977 nodes owned by various groups of people around the world. Also with Bitcoin or Ethereum any one can become a node whereas in Ripple this is not the case.

        Ripple labs was also funded by traditional venture capital versus an ICO model. Their last funding round consisted of a $200 million series-C in December of 2019.  They have been actively sued non stop by the US government and many other companies around the world non stop. They managed to eventually obtain a virtual currency license out of New York. Making it the 4th company ever to be granted a bit-license. Ripple is also known more for it’s payment protocol rather than it’s token.

        Another thing about Ripple that I would like to point out is that it appears cheap. The price pre-coin currently is $0.195 however the market cap is roughly $8.6 Billion. This makes it the third largest crypto in terms of market cap. I’ve noticed this seems to entice many people who are uneducated about financial markets to buy it thinking it will be the price of Bitcoin. What they fail to understand is what a market cap represents and it is usually upsetting seeing people buy in on this logic rather than actually educating themselves on the space.

        Ripple seems more geared towards larger banks and institutions rather than the general population. I believe this is what the founders geared it towards as well. Nothing wrong with that but I personally don’t see how this solves the possibility of corruption. However, I am very biased against Ripple. I’m sure some people in the world find it has a very good use case and I do wish Ripple Labs the best.
