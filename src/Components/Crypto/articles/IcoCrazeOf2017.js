        <h2> The ICO craze of 2017 </h2>

        <p> 
            An ICO is a “Initial Coin offering” that is held on the ethereum block-chain via smart 
            contracts. They were all the hype back in 2017 when the ICO market was going nuts. You 
            would see coins ICO then get listed on an exchange only to 20x within one to two weeks 
            for a few months. Most of those ICO’s however either failed completely over time, turned 
            out to be scams, or rarely they succeeded. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Making returns on ICO’s is cool and all but do you know what’s cooler? The way that they 
            enable people to raise funds for a company / project. They made it so that you did not 
            have to go through a VC or accredited investor necessarily. Instead you were able to 
            crowd fund from anyone, anywhere in the world. This did however spark some conservatory 
            within  certain government regulations around the world in regards to these ICO’s. 
        </p>

        <h2> Most ICO’s completely failed </h2>

        <p> 
            There were coins and projects that literally raised billions with nothing other than a 
            white paper, .io site, and a team of people. Projects like Tezos, EOS, and FileCoin 
            raised termoneds amounts of money for their teams during this time period. Most 
            coins had over -90% returns on their investments. However what I think 
            people fail to realize that can be quick to call them “a scam” is that investing early 
            in a company is super risky. Most VCs make investments in early stage companies 
            understanding that they will most likely fail and are okay with that. It is just you 
            don’t see those companies because nothing ever comes out of them and they go out of 
            business within one to two years. 
        </p>

        <h2> Although Some ICO’s Succeeded </h2> 

        <p>
            Some of the projects that chose to use and ICO in ordre to raise funds for their projects 
            did end up succeeding. Some examples of this would be  tokens like BAT and LINK. 
            Brave browser (BAT) was launched and started by the creator of javascript. They were able 
            to raise a whopping $35 million in about 30 seconds via ICO. pretty crazy. LINK was also 
            about to raise about $32 million within a short time frame as well with a cap of only 7 
            ETH aloud per person to invest during the ICO. ETH was another successful ICO raising 
            about $16 million within about a month of the ICO. 
        </p>

        <h2> China Regulations </h2>

        <p>
            China flat out banned them mid 2017 and caused the price of ETH to “dip” briefly but 
            mainly recovered. The Chinese government claimed all ICOs to be illegal.
        </p>

        <h2> US Regulations </h2>

        <p>
            The United States left it as a “grey area” that basically came down to whether or not 
            your project succeeded in a way. If the project raised a lot of funds at the ICO and 
            failed, the US basically called it “illegal” and went after some people that did the ICO 
            if it was based in the US. They also sued a few celebrities, like Floyd Mayweather, that 
            were promoting ICO’s to try and stop the spread of them to people who were not accredited 
            investors or VCs. However if the project succeeded, like BAT token or LINK (chain-link), 
            the United States government did not go after them. 
        </p>

        <h2> Switzerland Regulations </h2> 

        <p>
            Switzerland currently has one of the best regulations on ICOs and what they classify 
            them as. Most of it depends on what the use case of the token is that you are selling 
            off in order to raise funds. It mainly boils down to if it is legit and you're trying 
            to innovate then you can do it. But if you try to raise money and then do nothing then 
            it is most likely going to be an issue. It gets more complicated than that but that is 
            mainly what I got from reviewing it.  
        </p>

        <h2> Upside for Investors </h2> 

        <p>
            Another cool thing about ICO for potential investors or people who wanted to help fund 
            the projects was that it provided instantly liquidity in a way to people who invested in 
            it if the token was to be listed on an exchange. Most of the time VC’s and angle 
            investors are stuck on paper for a few years on their investments. Meaning that they can 
            only sell their share of a company if someone is willing to buy it from them or if the 
            company decides to IPO.
        </p>

        <h2> Conclusion </h2>

        <p> 
            More modern times though I do believe things like quadratic funding can be a cool 
            alternative to ICO’s but that is for a different post. Hopefully we see more teams 
            able to raise funds and create projects that help benefit the crypto ecosystem.
